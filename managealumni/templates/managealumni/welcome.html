<h1>Informal IESA Alumni Association</h1>

<h2>What is IESA?</h2>

<p>IESA was formed in 2001 on the Gainesville campus. The Institute promotes environmental education through the use of advanced technology, <br>
    interdisciplinary instruction, collaborative learning, and service.  The Institute brings together the perspectives of numerous disciplines through <br>
    the synthesis of Geospatial Technology, applied techniques, and theory to address social, human and environmental issues.  Students, faculty, and staff<br>
    work together with industry, government, and community partners through their coursework resulting in a dynamic and socially relevant learning environment.</p>
